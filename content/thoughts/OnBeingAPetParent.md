# On being a (temporary) pet parent, multiple times

Ever since I remember, I'd always been afraid of animals. Be it a cockroach or a friendly golden retriever. I've run away from them, hid from them, cried from fear, screamed at others too. Even 4 years back, I remember my sister-in-law's cat walking into the hall and me cowering away. Her kittens tried to climb onto my lap, and their claws were the most ferocious things for months. And they were adorable.

I could always appreciate their visual appeal. Just, from a distance. 

3 years ago, my husband brought a stray kitten into our house. We had heard its meows all day. It was scared and hungry, hiding under cars in our apartment parking lot. It drank from the bowl of milk we had placed, but didn't come out to show its pretty face. I had gone out to meet a friend, came home and heard a low meow in the house! My husband (lets call him Hari) tells me not to get scared, or scare the kitten, and introduces me to a tiny bundle of gray, with wide frightened eyes. It was the cutest kitten I've ever seen. Look at me so frightened of that tiny thing.

She was friendly, got used to us quickly, and very soon was using me as a mattress. And I loved it. She had infinite energy and so much curiosity. She'd trot around the house sniffing and swatting her tiny paws at everything. She'd fall asleep at the oddest places. We wanted her to be an outdoor cat, so she'd go out and walk in at her will. She was my first floofball and my favourite.
