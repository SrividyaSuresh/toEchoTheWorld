# On being a (temporary) pet parent, multiple times

Ever since I remember, I'd always been afraid of animals. Be it a cockroach or a friendly golden retriever. I've run away from them, hid from them, cried from fear, screamed at others too. Even 4 years back, I remember my sister-in-law's cat walking into the hall and me cowering away. Her kittens tried to climb onto my lap, and their claws were the most ferocious things for months. And they were adorable. I could always appreciate their visual appeal. Just, from a distance. 

3 years ago, my husband brought a stray kitten into our house. We had heard its meows all day. It was scared and hungry, hiding under cars in our apartment parking lot. It drank from the bowl of milk we had placed.
