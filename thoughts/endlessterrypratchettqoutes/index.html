This will come as no surprise to anyone who knows anything about me, my favourite author is Sir Terry Pratchett. Anytime I crave humour, wit, and philosophy, he is the one I turn to. Its no exaggeration when I say that I&rsquo;m a better person cos of him.

One blog post, however often updated, isn&rsquo;t sufficient for his words. I&rsquo;m planning on creating a website soon, but until then, here&rsquo;s a few of my favourite excerpts.</p><h3 id=going-postal>Going Postal</h3><p>“Do you understand what I&rsquo;m saying?"
shouted Moist. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just go around killing people!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why Not? You Do.&rdquo; The golem lowered his arm.
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; snapped Moist. &ldquo;I do not! Who told you that?&rdquo;
&ldquo;I Worked It Out. You Have Killed Two Point Three Three Eight People,&rdquo; said the golem calmly.
&ldquo;I have never laid a finger on anyone in my life, Mr Pump. I may be–– all the things you know I am, but I am not a killer! I have never so much as drawn a sword!&rdquo;
&ldquo;No, You Have Not. But You Have Stolen, Embezzled, Defrauded And Swindled Without Discrimination, Mr Lipvig. You Have Ruined Businesses And Destroyed Jobs. When Banks Fail, It Is Seldom Bankers Who Starve. Your Actions Have Taken Money From Those Who Had Little Enough To Begin With. In A Myriad Small Ways You Have Hastened The Deaths Of Many. You Do Not Know Them. You Did Not See Them Bleed. But You Snatched Bread From Their Mouths And Tore Clothes From Their Backs. For Sport, Mr Lipvig. For Sport. For The Joy Of The Game.”</p><h3 id=the-colour-of-magic>The colour of magic</h3><p>&ldquo;[2 turtles carrying worlds on their back travel through space] When they arrived they would briefly and passionately mate, for the first and only time, and from that fiery union new turtles would be born to carry a new pattern of worlds. This was known as the Big Bang hypothesis.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=small-gods>Small Gods</h3><p>&ldquo;Humans! They lived in a world where the grass continued to be green and the sun rose every day and flowers regularly turned into fruit, and what impressed them? Weeping statues. And wine made out of water! A mere quantum-mechanistic tunnel effect, that&rsquo;d happen anyway if you were prepared to wait zillions of years. As if the turning of sunlight into wine, by means of vines and grapes and time and enzymes, wasn&rsquo;t a thousand times more impressive and happened all the time&mldr;&rdquo;</p><h3 id=men-at-arms>Men at arms</h3><p>&ldquo;The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.
Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.
But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that&rsquo;d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years&rsquo; time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.</p><p>This was the Captain Samuel Vimes &lsquo;Boots&rsquo; theory of socioeconomic unfairness.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=small-gods-1>Small Gods</h3><p>&ldquo;What have I always believed?
That on the whole, and by and large, if a man lived properly, not according to what any priests said, but according to what seemed decent and honest inside, then it would, at the end, more or less, turn out all right.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=thief-of-time>Thief of time</h3><p>&ldquo;The first words that are read by seekers of enlightenment in the secret, gong-banging, yeti-haunted valleys near the hub of the world, are when they look into The Life of Wen the Eternally Surprised.
The first question they ask is: &lsquo;Why was he eternally surprised?&rsquo;
And they are told: &lsquo;Wen considered the nature of time and understood that the universe is, instant by instant, recreated anew. Therefore, he understood, there is in truth no past, only a memory of the past. Blink your eyes, and the world you see next did not exist when you closed them. Therefore, he said, the only appropriate state of the mind is surprise. The only appropriate state of the heart is joy. The sky you see now, you have never seen before. The perfect moment is now. Be glad of it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-truth>The truth</h3><p>&ldquo;We’ve always been privileged, you see. Privilege just means ‘private law.’ That’s exactly what it means. He just doesn’t believe the ordinary laws apply to him. He really believes they can’t touch him, and that if they do he can just shout until they go away. That’s the de Worde tradition, and we’re good at it. Shout&rdquo;</p><h3 id=hogfather>Hogfather</h3><p>&ldquo;And then Jack chopped down what was the world&rsquo;s last beanstalk, adding murder and ecological terrorism to the theft, enticement, and trespass charges already mentioned, and all the giant&rsquo;s children didn&rsquo;t have a daddy anymore. But he got away with it and lived happily ever after, without so much as a guilty twinge about what he had done&mldr;which proves that you can be excused for just about anything if you are a hero, because no one asks inconvenient questions.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=moving-pictures>Moving Pictures</h3><p>&ldquo;You know what the greatest tragedy is in the whole world?&mldr; It&rsquo;s all the people who never find out what it is they really want to do or what it is they&rsquo;re really good at. It&rsquo;s all the sons who become blacksmiths because their fathers were blacksmiths. It&rsquo;s all the people who could be really fantastic flute players who grow old and die without ever seeing a musical instrument, so they become bad plowmen instead. It&rsquo;s all the people with talents who never even find out. Maybe they are never even born in a time when it&rsquo;s even possible to find out. It&rsquo;s all the people who never get to know what it is that they can really be. It&rsquo;s all the wasted chances.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=reaper-man>Reaper man</h3><p>&ldquo;Belief is one of the most powerful organic forces in the multiverse. It may not be able to move mountains, exactly. But it can create someone who can.
People get exactly the wrong idea about belief. They think it works back to front. They think the sequence is, first object, then belief. In fact, it works the other way.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=wee-free-men>Wee free men</h3><p>&ldquo;The stories never said why she was wicked. It was enough to be an old woman, enough to be all alone, enough to look strange because you have no teeth. It was enough to be called a witch. If it came to that, the book never gave you the evidence of anything. It talked about &lsquo;a handsome prince&rsquo;&mldr; was he really, or was it just because he was a prince that people called handsome?.. The stories don&rsquo;t want you to think, they just wanted you to believe what you were told&mldr;&rdquo;</p><h3 id=the-colour-of-magic-1>The colour of magic</h3><p>“He stopped and stared intently at Rincewind. &ldquo;Every night I come out here and look down.&rdquo; he finished, &ldquo;and I never jump. Courage is hard to come by, here on the Edge.”</p><h3 id=small-gods-2>Small Gods</h3><p>&ldquo;Just because you can explain it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not still a miracle.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=going-postal-1>Going Postal</h3><p>“Never promise to do the possible. Anyone could do the possible. You should promise to do the impossible, because sometimes the impossible was possible, if you could find the right way, and at least you could often extend the limits of the possible. And if you failed, well, it had been impossible.”</p><h3 id=pyramids>Pyramids</h3><p>&ldquo;Seeing, contrary to popular wisdom, isn&rsquo;t believing. It&rsquo;s where belief stops, because it isn&rsquo;t needed any more.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=equal-rites>Equal rites</h3><p>&ldquo;Zoon tribes are very proud of their Liars. Other races get very annoyed about all this. They feel that the Zoon ought to have adopted more suitable titles, like &lsquo;diplomat&rsquo; or &lsquo;public relations officer&rsquo;. They feel they are poking fun at the whole thing.”</p><h3 id=moving-pictures-1>Moving Pictures</h3><p>&ldquo;Everything looks interesting until you do it. Then you find it&rsquo;s just another job.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=thief-of-time-1>Thief of time</h3><p>&ldquo;The thing is, I mean, there’s times when you look at the universe and you think, &lsquo;What about me?&rsquo; and you can just hear the universe replying, &lsquo;Well, what about you?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><h3 id=wee-free-men-1>Wee free men</h3><p>&ldquo;Open your eyes and then open your eyes again.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=reaper-man-1>Reaper Man</h3><p>&ldquo;Most species do their own evolving, making it up as they go along, which is the way Nature intended. And this is all very natural and organic and in tune with mysterious cycles of the cosmos, which believes that there&rsquo;s nothing like millions of years of really frustrating trial and error to give a species moral fiber and, in some cases, backbone.&rdquo;</p><p>Imagine my surprise when I forked Hugo Bear codes and saw <em>X-Clacks-Overhead</em> and <em>GNU Terry Pratchett</em></p></content><p></p></main><footer>Made with <a href=https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/>Hugo ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear</a></footer></body></html>
