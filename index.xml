&lt;p>This will come as no surprise to anyone who knows anything about me, my favourite author is Sir Terry Pratchett. Anytime I crave humour, wit, and philosophy, he is the one I turn to. Its no exaggeration when I say that I&amp;rsquo;m a better person cos of him.

&lt;p>I’ve been wanting to start a blog for a while now. Somthing that integrates my love for tech with everything else in my life. I wanted to build it from scratch, make it my own. Cos UI isn&amp;rsquo;t my strongest skill, I kept putting it off for another day, a day when I&amp;rsquo;ll be awesome at HTML, CSS, JS and everything else in between.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Moments</title><link>https://srividyasuresh.github.io/toEchoTheWorld/moments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://srividyasuresh.github.io/toEchoTheWorld/moments/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
